IMPORTANT -
# The college publicly displays the results which is not quite right.
# It is a humble request to not publish the result findings on public platforms.
# Not everyone is as open as one wants to be. Respect that. Please.

Notes -
# Python version 3+
# No other external dependancies. (except ofcourse Result pdfs)
# Result pdfs need to be UTF-8 converted. (Else give decode error in reading)

Basic Running -
# Parses all files from 'Result' folder in working directory.
# Analyses stuff only if there in the ResAnalysis.py
# If you want to analyse something of your own, open the file in Python's
# original IDLE (GUI) & try your stuff out.
# Read through the code if you dont get what you are looking for, there are
# some examples in there.

Guidelines for newbs -
# Backup is something everyone MUST have.
# PyScripter is a great IDE, use it for editing.
# The parsing code is quite crude at the moment but that is the way PDF works.
# Help yourself, if you can't move on even after a few hours, seek !mmorta!'s help.
# Things have been tried to be kept simple. Do the same.
# Happy open sourcing! :)
